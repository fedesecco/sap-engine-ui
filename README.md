# sap-engine-ui
This project simply reads a json file with the status of a Super Auto Pet game, and reproduces it graphically. Used to better visualize information passed by move predictor engines.

The test-api.json file is an example of how the game status need to be formatted to be properly read by this app.


Assets:

Background and empty pet obtained with a screenshot of a real game.

All pets and foods are taken from https://github.com/bencoveney/super-auto-pets-db
